Iris flower has three species- 1. setosa 2. versicolor 3. virginica, which differs according to their measurements.
Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
Dataset contain:
1. Iris-setosa-50
2. Iris-versicolor - 50
3. Iris-virginica -50

##### Model used for deployment : KNeighborsClassifier

Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Decision tree classifier 
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. Logistic Regression 

I completed the task successfully and made a website to predict the class using machine learning model.
